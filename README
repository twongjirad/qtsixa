QtSixA is the Sixaxis Joystick Manager
 ------------------------------------

QtSixA can connect PS3 hardware (Sixaxis/DualShock3, Keypads and Remotes)
to a Linux-compatible machine.

"QtSixA" is the GUI (interface), while "sixad" is the backend C++ code.

Currently sixad supports:
 - Sixaxis/DualShock3 (buttons, axis, accelerometers, leds and rumble)
 - PS3 Keypads
 - PS3 BD Remotes

sixad also registers the hardware's MAC/ID in the device name
(ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (00:XX:X0:0X:XX)".

 -------------------------------------

QtSixA and sixad are licensed under the GNU GPL v2 license.

Savings edits to work with Pop OS 21.01.

* pre-req: `sudo apt install pyqt5-dev-tools`
* changed `qtsixa/Makefile` to use `pyuic5` instead of `pyuic4`
* changed `qtsixa/Makefile` to use `pyrcc5` instead of `pyrcc4`

Tested to work with PS3 Dualshock 3 controller as of 2022/11/23.
